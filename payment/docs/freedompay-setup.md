# FreedomPay Services Setup

For FreedomPay development you should receive the following from Zivelo:

* A windows machine pre-installed with FreedomPay services
* A card scanner pre-installed with FreedomPay firmware
* A front facing plate adapter to mount the card scanner to your kiosk

This is in addition to the OakOS machine you will be developing your application on.  Please contact your Zivelo representative if you are missing any components.

For the physical setup of this hardware, you should ensure the following:

1. The card scanner is connected via USB to the Windows machine with FreedomPay services.
2. The windows machine is connected via network cable to the same router or switch that hosts the OakOS machine.
3. The windows machine and OakOS machine should be mounted to the inside of the kiosk, and the card scanner should be mounted to the front of the kiosk with the provided adapter.

Please talk with the Zivelo technical team when this has been completed and we can run a test purchase with the FreedomPay services to ensure that everything is connected properly.

When that is done you're ready to make the connection from our OakOS Payment Sample App.
