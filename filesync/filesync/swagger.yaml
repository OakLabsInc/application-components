  description: |
    Manage automatic synchronization of files to be served at /assets/
    on this mirror.

    Files are synced to this mirror from Google Cloud Storage every 10
    minutes on the 10th minute automatically. They are then served
    locally at https://localhost/assets/. Directories served there
    have auto-generated JSON indexes.

    Forcing a sync to start will not change the schedule of future
    syncs. Syncs will be skipped only if there is a sync already in
    progress when they are scheduled to start.
